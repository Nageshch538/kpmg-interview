# Convert the Flask-based application into a Docker image
# Push it to ECR
# Launch it on ECS
Build a serverless CI/CD pipeline
**
Requirements
To successfully follow the steps in this article, make sure have the following accounts, tools, and prerequisite knowledge:

Accounts & Cloud Environment
GitHub account — for repository and GitHub Actions usage
AWS account — with sufficient permissions to access ECR, ECS, and IAM
Required Tools (must be installed and configured locally)
Git — for version control
Docker Engine — to build and test Docker images
AWS CLI — to interact with AWS services via terminal (AWS credentials)
Technologies Used
GitHub Actions → Automates CI/CD workflows
Docker → Containerizes the Flask application
Amazon ECR → Stores Docker images
Amazon ECS (Fargate) → Runs containers without managing servers
IAM → Manages secure access

in proress:
modularized the code into logical units: vpc, ecs, rds, alb, etc., with input variables for all
environment-specific values. Modules expose minimal outputs and hide internal resources.

I followed naming conventions and enforced documentation using README.md for each
module. 
Environment separation was achieved using a consistent folder structure and single
env.tfvars per environment. This made the code DRY, reusable across projects, and aligned
with GitOps practices.



Consideration for Production:

Compute: ASG, Lambda
Networking: VPC peering, Transit gateway, NACLs, NAT Gateways
storage: S3 inteliigent tiering, synchronous data manage systems
Security: IAM roles least previlege, WAF, private subnets 
IAM: role based matrix with least previleges
secret password protection: secret managers, OIDC with scopes IAM roles, Github actions secrets
deployment: ECS/EKS Cdutom CRDs, SErvice mesh, Helm
Backup: Versioning, rollbacks, data replics over multiple regions
disaster recovery: DRG techniques, replicas, ALB health checks and auto replacement, data retentions and replicas, versioning, cross-region replication
zero downtime/ HA: sandbox, multi AZ,ALB health checks,  blue/green deployment, canary deployment, pre-prod to mirror prod
Fault Tolerance: ECS task replacement, data replication in mylti AZ,S3 for durable storage, Route 53 health checks enabled for DNS fails.
Environment drift: immutable infra, versioning, state backend, state locking
Monitoring: notification service, log monitoring, alert action groups/cloudwatch(CPU/Memory, Task count, latency, error rate,API performance) 
Future growth: scalability, NAT gateway for private subnets, CIDR sizing, vpc peering
Cost optimization: resource right-sizing, serverless, scheduld scaling, prevent over provisioning, leverage savings plans
